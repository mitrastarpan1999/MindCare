Place the attached image file in the client public folder if you prefer serving it from the frontend.

Optional steps (useful for local development without backend image serving):

1. Save the portrait image you attached as `dr_bhawana_jain.jpg`.
2. Put the file at:
   d:\Arpan\2025\dec\06\crse\MentalH\client\public\images\dr_bhawana_jain.jpg
3. Restart the Vite dev server (`npm run dev` in the `client` folder) so the file is served.

If you place the image here you can use this URL in the browser while running the client:



Choose either server uploads or client public; placing the file in both ensures both areas work.
